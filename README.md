This project analyzes Canada’s monthly provincial employment data (1976–2019) from the Labor Market Council of Canada. My team explored long-term labor market trends across provinces, sexes, and employment types (full-time vs. part-time), applying time-series forecasting and clustering techniques. Our goal was to identify provincial disparities, demographic patterns, and structural shifts in employment over four decades, offering insights into Canada’s economic resilience and evolution.
